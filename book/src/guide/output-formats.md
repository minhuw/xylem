# Output Formats

> **TODO**: This section is under development. Output format configuration and examples will be added once the implementation is validated.

## Planned Support

Xylem will support multiple output formats for results and metrics:
- Text (human-readable)
- JSON (machine-readable)
- CSV (for analysis)

Check back later for detailed documentation on output configuration.
