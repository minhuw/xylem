# YCSB Workload C: Read Only
#
# Application Example: User profile cache, where profiles are constructed elsewhere (e.g., Hadoop)
#
# Characteristics:
# - 100% reads
# - Zipfian request distribution (hot keys)
# - 1 million record keyspace
# - Values: 1KB (simulating 10 fields × 100 bytes each)
#
# This workload represents a pure read scenario, typical for applications
# where data is loaded once and then only read (no updates during benchmark).
