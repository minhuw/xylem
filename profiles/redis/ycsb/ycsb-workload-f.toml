# YCSB Workload F: Read-Modify-Write
#
# Application Example: User database, where user records are read and modified
#
# Characteristics:
# - 50% reads, 50% read-modify-write (simulated as SET)
# - Zipfian request distribution (hot keys)
# - 1 million record keyspace
# - Values: 1KB (simulating 10 fields × 100 bytes each)
