# YCSB Workload D: Read Latest
#
# Application Example: User status updates; people want to read the latest statuses
#
# Characteristics:
# - 95% reads, 5% inserts
# - Latest distribution (reads favor recently inserted records)
# - Growing keyspace (inserts add new records)
# - Values: 1KB (simulating 10 fields × 100 bytes each)
#
# This workload represents a scenario where new records are continuously inserted
# and reads favor the most recently inserted records (recency pattern).
