# YCSB Workload A: Update Heavy
#
# Application Example: Session store recording recent actions
#
# Characteristics:
# - 50% reads, 50% updates (read-modify-write)
# - Zipfian request distribution (hot keys)
# - 1 million record keyspace
# - Values: 1KB (simulating 10 fields × 100 bytes each)
#
# This workload represents a typical cache scenario where data is frequently
# both read and updated, with some keys accessed much more than others.
