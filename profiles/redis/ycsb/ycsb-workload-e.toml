# YCSB Workload E: Short Ranges
#
# Application Example: Threaded conversations, where each scan is for the posts in a given thread
#
# Characteristics:
# - 95% scans, 5% inserts
# - Zipfian request distribution for scan starting points
# - Short range scans (1-100 records)
# - Values: 1KB (simulating 10 fields × 100 bytes each)
#
# NOTE: Redis SCAN iterates over keys, not ordered ranges. For true ordered
# range queries, you'd need sorted sets (ZRANGE). This configuration uses
# GET as a placeholder since SCAN is not fully supported in weighted operations.
