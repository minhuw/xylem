# Facebook TAO Workload: Social Graph Cache
#
# Based on: "Workload Analysis of a Large-Scale Key-Value Store" (Facebook, 2012)
# and TAOBench (2023)
#
# TAO (The Associations and Objects) is Facebook's distributed data store for the social graph.
# It handles queries like "get friend list", "get recent posts", "get photo tags", etc.
#
# Characteristics (from production traces):
# - 99.8% reads, 0.2% writes (extremely read-heavy)
# - High key locality (social graphs have clustering)
# - Small objects: median ~100 bytes
# - Object size distribution: long-tail (most small, some large)
# - Access patterns: bursty (follows user activity patterns)
# - Query patterns: mostly point queries with some multi-gets
# - Diurnal patterns: follows human activity cycles
#
# Key Insights:
# - Friend/follower lists accessed much more than posts
# - "Hot" users (celebrities) create extreme skew
# - Most accesses are for recent content (temporal locality)
# - Multi-get operations are common (fetch multiple related objects)

# ============================================================================
# NOTES ON TAO CHARACTERISTICS
# ============================================================================
#
# 1. Object Types in TAO:
#    - Objects: Users, posts, photos, pages, events
#    - Associations: Friendships, likes, comments, tags, group memberships
#    - Objects tend to be larger, associations are smaller
#
# 2. Query Patterns:
#    - assoc_get: Get edges of a certain type from a node (e.g., friends of user X)
#    - obj_get: Get object by ID
#    - assoc_count: Count edges (e.g., number of friends)
#    - assoc_range: Get range of associations (e.g., latest 20 posts)
#
# 3. Caching Strategy:
#    - Write-through cache (writes go to DB, then invalidate cache)
#    - Cache miss triggers DB query
#    - Aggressive pre-fetching for common patterns
#
# 4. Production Observations (from Facebook papers):
#    - 99.8% of operations are reads
#    - Get-hit ratio: ~96% (very effective caching)
#    - Median object size: ~100 bytes
#    - P99 object size: ~2KB
#    - Multi-get batching reduces round trips by 50%
#
# 5. Key Locality Patterns:
#    - Strong temporal locality: Recent posts/photos accessed more
#    - Strong spatial locality: Related objects accessed together
#    - Social graph clustering: Friends-of-friends pattern
#
# 6. Scaling Characteristics:
#    - Horizontal partitioning by object ID
#    - Replication for read scaling
#    - Regional caches to reduce latency
#
# 7. Limitations of This Simulation:
#    - Real TAO uses custom protocol optimizations
#    - Association queries not directly mappable to Redis GET/SET
#    - Would need sorted sets (ZRANGE) for assoc_range queries
#    - True TAO has sophisticated invalidation and consistency protocols
