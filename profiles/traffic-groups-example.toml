# Traffic Groups Example - Mimicking Lancet's Throughput/Latency Agent Separation
#
# This configuration demonstrates the traffic groups feature, which allows
# multiple connection groups with independent policies, sampling rates, and
# thread assignments.
#
# This example creates:
# - Latency measurement group: 100% sampling, low rate, precise measurements
# - Throughput generation group: 1% sampling, high rate, max load

# Expected behavior:
# - Group "latency-measurement": Precise P99 latency measurements at 2K QPS
# - Group "throughput-generation": High load generation at ~98K QPS
# - Output will show separate statistics for each group
# - Total system load: ~100K QPS
# - Thread 0-1: Latency measurements
# - Thread 2-5: Throughput generation
